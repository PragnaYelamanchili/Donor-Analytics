All organizations should get to know their supporters, and prospective supporters, better. Without out a clear understanding of this, organizations are unlikely to see a high return on their
fundraising efforts. Over many years, organizations have sourced donation data from various channels, surveys, and notes collected by the staff. As a result, they have access to vast amounts
of information that could be used to gain meaningful insight as it relates to the donor/donation domain. Briefly stated, four factors that are often key when analyzing donor behavior include their engagement history, giving habits, prospective giving capacity/propensity, and
communication preferences.

Survival analysis refers to the set of statistical analyses that are used to analyze the length of time until an event of interest occurs. The phrase survival time is used to refer to the type of variable
of interest. It is often also referred to as failure time and waiting time. Such studies generally work with data leading up to an event of interest along with several other characteristics of
individual data points that may be used to explain the survival times statistically. The statistical problem (survival analysis) is to construct and estimate an appropriate model of
the time of event occurrence. A survival model fulfills the following expectations:
● Yield predictions of a number of individuals who will fail (undergo the event of interest) at any length of time since the beginning of observation (or other decided point in time).
● Estimate the effect of observable individual characteristics on the survival time (to check the relevance of one variable holding constant all others).
It is often observed that the survival models, such as proportional hazard model, are capable of explaining the survival times in terms of observed characteristics which is better than straightforward statistical inferences such as rates of event occurrence without considering
characteristic features of data.
